 ### Item "Boxes" (LineItems & InventoryItems)
 Because Items are only defining *types* of physical inventory, we need a vehicle to track *quantities*. This application does this by piggybacking on the association. We currently use two different kinds of associations: **Line Items** and **Inventory Items**. The main practical difference between the two is that the quantities of "Line Items" are non-zero integers and the quantities of "Inventory Items" are natural numbers.

-[Partnerbase](/rubyforgood/partner) is a companion application built in-tandem with this application. It interfaces directly with the Community Partners that work with the recipients of the sanitary supplies. Both applications are dependent on one another, but each address separate needs and so are maintained separately. They connect via an API. Please see the Partnerbase repository for more information.
