-Since we now use `webpacker`, we also use `yarn` to maintain our JS assets. 
-
-# Platforms
-Installing `yarn` is different depending on your OS. Find your platform below and follow the directions.
-
-## Linux
- 1. Add the repository
-```bash
-curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
-echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
-```
- 2. Install `yarn`
-```bash
-sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yarn
-```
-If you run into trouble, check the [source page](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable). 
-
-## Mac
-Easiest to install this via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
-```bash
-brew install yarn
-```
-If you run into trouble, check the [source page](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
-
-## Cloud 9
-
-You can't just follow the [directions on the site](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#linux-tab), you have to do some mojo first.
-
- 1. Run update.
-```bash
-sudo apt-get update
-```
-
- 2. Install apt-transport-https.
-```bash
-sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
-```
-
- 3. Configure the repository (from Yarn installation).
-```bash
-curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
-echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
-```
-
- 4. Run update again and install Yarn.
-```bash
-sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yarn
-```
-
-You're good to go! (Thanks to [Mike Rourke](https://gist.github.com/mikerourke/0c2cac1bec77fb4c1d875bfaee487074))
