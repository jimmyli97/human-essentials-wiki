 ## Production Activity
 
-* We're in production out of beta!
-* These diaper banks are trying to use the system with real-world data
-* That means the system is IN PRODUCTION and is the source-of-truth for some users
 * There are no particular times of usage, though likely US-daylight
-* Q: How do we communicate with users, like if we needed downtime?
-  * Testing users are encouraged to submit GitHub issues (all of them? trained?)
 
 ## Deployment
 
-* TravisCI deploys master
-  * Triggered by merge into master -- now that we're in production, auto deploys go to our staging server. Deploying to production requires tagging a release and then manually deploying it with Capistrano.
-  * Runs Capistrano deploy if the rest of the tests pass
-  * See [.travis.yml](https://github.com/rubyforgood/diaper/blob/main/.travis.yml)
-* Capistrano is used to perform the deploy
-  * See [config/deploy.rb](https://github.com/rubyforgood/diaper/blob/main/config/deploy.rb) for general config
-  * See [config/deploy/production.rb](https://github.com/rubyforgood/diaper/blob/main/config/deploy/production.rb) for production config
+* Cloud66 deploys from production branch
+  * See [README.md#Deployment-Process](https://github.com/rubyforgood/human-essentials?tab=readme-ov-file#deployment-process)
+  * See [.cloud66/manifest.yml](https://github.com/rubyforgood/human-essentials/blob/main/.cloud66/manifest.yml)
+  * See [config/puma.rb](https://github.com/rubyforgood/human-essentials/blob/main/config/puma.rb)
+  * See [config/environments/production.rb](https://github.com/rubyforgood/human-essentials/blob/main/config/environments/production.rb) for production config
   * Single server for DB and web server (Puma)
   * Uses hard-coded ip address
-  * We have the ability to deploy from a branch `cap production deploy BRANCH=branch_to_deploy`
 
 ## Monitoring, Alerting, Metrics
 
 * Bugsnag (we have an OSS account, contact an admin for access to it)
-* [Skylight](https://oss.skylight.io/app/applications/LrXHcxDK7Be9/recent/6h/endpoints) - Monitoring service
-
-## Production Debugging
-
-* A few admins (a-a-ron, sean, jcavena) have production shell access
-* We have the `capistrano-rails-console` gem installed. This allows us to run `cap production rails:console` which opens a production rails console from your local command line.
-
-## Disaster Recovery
-
-* [Issue #405 will add DB backups](https://github.com/rubyforgood/diaper/issues/405)
-* VM Snapshot (?)
+* Skylight - Monitoring service
